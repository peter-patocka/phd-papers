    abstract = {This text presents for the first time a methodology that combines the power of a modelling formalism such as coloured petri nets with the flexibility of a discreet event program such as SIMIO. Industrial practitioners have seen the growth of simulation as a methodology for tacking problems in which variability is the common denominator. Practically all industrial systems, from manufacturing to aviation are considered stochastic systems.},
